# C-rShell
A TCP based reverse shell app with some features I may hopefully integrate in the future.

I used some TCP code to implement my own (hopefully functional) reverse shell app that 
shows step by step on the server side what is going on in the client as you implement
a reverse shell, hence the name. 

Ill be honest I do not expect this to work as a great piece of malware, I believe this
will work as well as a script kiddie getting his hands on kali for the first time. 
Anything done by this app, whether harmful or not, I hope you do not attribute to 
me. This is just a side project I decided to make for my portfolio. (though if you
can make it any better than it is right now, it wouldnt make it a bad base for
malware).
